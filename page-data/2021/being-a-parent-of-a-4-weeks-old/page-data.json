At some point my wife and I just gave up because nothing we did woke him up, feeling as if he is sound asleep he probably didn't have any hunger.</p>\n<p>Also at the consultation bureau, they didn't have any remarks on his growth and weight and said that we can make appointments every 2 weeks instead of every week.</p>\n<p>The only downside, when he was 3 weeks old he had a special day and since then he doesn't sleep that long at night anymore. So the nights have become way more long and stressful.</p>\n<p>However this is all part of the deal, and I don't want to have it any other way, as this is the first real time a guy has stolen my heart,</p>"}},"createdOn":"April 19, 2021","topics":[{"id":"1cb7c629-f677-5ef9-810f-fbcbb097befd","title":"Life","slug":"life"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"b67b6af5-5c20-5a00-8a3c-e354f00ccfd2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
