Git wasn't really being used and there was almost no structure to projects.</p>\n<p>While I love structure, it soon became clear that if I wanted structure I have to make it myself. Semi taking the lead role to setup a nice underlying structure for the work being done.</p>\n<p>Jump ahead one year later, we now have local development and git flow being used and almost understood by everyone in the company.</p>\n<p>So what will the upcoming year hold? Most likely automated tests or automated deployments. Hopefully both, at least I will be appointed Lead developer, the position I have hunted for since my start here.</p>\n<p>The upcoming year will hold a lot of promise with a lot of changes coming this way, both challenging as emotional.</p>"}},"createdOn":"January 14, 2021","topics":[{"id":"1cb7c629-f677-5ef9-810f-fbcbb097befd","title":"Life","slug":"life"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"11b62a70-e858-5af9-b6dd-4229047f9fe3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
