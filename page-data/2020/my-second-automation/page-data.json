A pro, devices have no internet access, but can be succeptable to hackers as you only need to transmit an RF signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Z-Wage</strong><br>\nThis is a neck on neck race with Zigbee, the main weakness in my account is that it can controll up to 232 devices, which in the beginning seems like a huge number, but it will keep growing pretty quickly when you get hooked. Security wise it is great as the devices themselves have no internet access.</p>\n<p><strong>Zigbee</strong><br>\nFor me in my context this is the winner as it supports networks with a lot of devices going into the 1000s, is secure in home using zigbee2mqtt, is cheap using xiaomi/ IKEA components.
