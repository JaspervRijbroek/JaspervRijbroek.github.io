Might add an automation rule to turn off the lights when\nwatching a movie, and turning it back on when the movie is paused or stopped. </p>\n<p>Will post an update when the rest of the hardware arrives!</p>","fields":{"date":"May 13, 2020","path":"/2020/first-automated-room"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First automated room","description":"Babysteps to a smart home","topics":["smart home"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"956d403f-0925-5101-b3c8-57539e0e8167","topics":["smart home"]}}}
