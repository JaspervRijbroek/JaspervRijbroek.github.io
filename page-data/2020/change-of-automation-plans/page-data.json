And after a disassembly I found out that it doesn't have an antenna, which\nwas the initial issue.</p>\n<p>However, there is a small thing to keep in mind, that is that the lights of the Ikea do require\na constant supply of 230V(olts) which might be a little strange when changing a light bulb,\nbut then again how much does that happen a year. In my 7 years in this house I had to change a\nlight bulb twice.</p>\n<p>At the end of this month my new smart switch will be delivered, and I will go to Ikea to retrieve\na couple of Tradfi light bulbs, and then I will try to set it up again, but this time\na little more aesthetically pleasing for my wife.</p>\n<p>When this is done I will post some more pictures with the first test scenarios and how\nthe wife responds to them.</p>","fields":{"date":"June 01, 2020","path":"/2020/change-of-automation-plans"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Change of plans","description":"We need to adjust our home automation plans","topics":["smart home"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"nodes":[{"id":"06ceccec-c1c2-5dd1-a2a0-6d82d527ccf0","fields":{"date":"July 31, 2020","path":"/2020/second-automation"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My second automation"}},{"id":"956d403f-0925-5101-b3c8-57539e0e8167","fields":{"date":"May 13, 2020","path":"/2020/first-automated-room"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First automated room"}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d556e09b-50ee-55ed-bb12-d8ff3b4cf2f0","topics":["smart home"]}}}
