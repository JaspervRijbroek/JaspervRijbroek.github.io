With a good TV and a good soundbar I also want the full movies experience, as soon as the TV starts the lights dimm to their minimum (only when turned on already). And when the TV shuts down, the lamps turn on again.</p>\n<p>Also I was having a wireless aqara double key switch which I now use to turn on and off the lights in the living room.</p>\n<p>Next to me on the bedstand I have another switch, which already turned off the fan in the bathroom, this button no also turns off the living room lights in case I have forgot to turn them off (and if the phone is too far away).</p>\n<p>So in short, this is the third room I have now automated and functional, I will see if the wife thinks that this is an improvement or not, but automations can (and will be) changed if needed.</p>\n<p>I will keep you all posted.</p>"}},"createdOn":"November 08, 2020","topics":[{"id":"09c582e0-1ea7-5fe8-891e-e22a2297f238","title":"Smart Home","slug":"smart-home"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"f0545bb0-eb59-5eee-b012-70e8fb0a2f28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
