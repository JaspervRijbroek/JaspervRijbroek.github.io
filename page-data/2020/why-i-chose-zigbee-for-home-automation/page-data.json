As I don't want any spies or other wise entries into my home, unless I say so! (yes, I am a control freak)</p>\n<p>There where the following protocols to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WiFi</li>\n<li>Z-Wave</li>\n<li>Zigbee</li>\n<li>RF (Radio Frequency)</li>\n<li>Proprietary</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proprietary</strong>\nThis was off the bat a no go, as there was no control over on what happens and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>WiFi</strong>\nMy main concern here was security and privacy, as the device has a connection to the WiFi it could do all kinds of nasty things like send out usage, or make it a little more interesting, execute code on my network received from external source, so a no go.</p>\n<p><strong>RF (Radio Frequency)</strong>\nThe issue I had with this protocol is that there is no communication between the devices, it is just one way, so when turning on or off a device the controller sends out 3 messages, hoping that one will be received, apart from the range issue. A pro, devices have no internet access, but can be succeptable to hackers as you only need to transmit an RF signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Z-Wage</strong>\nThis is a neck on neck race with Zigbee, the main weakness in my account is that it can controll up to 232 devices, which in the beginning seems like a huge number, but it will keep growing pretty quickly when you get hooked. Security wise it is great as the devices themselves have no internet access.</p>\n<p><strong>Zigbee</strong>\nFor me in my context this is the winner as it supports networks with a lot of devices going into the 1000s, is secure in home using zigbee2mqtt, is cheap using xiaomi/ IKEA components. And as another secure part it has no internet access of its own.</p>\n<p>So that is the short of it, I will keep my devices on zigbee using zigbee2mqtt.</p>\n<p>See you later!</p>"}},"createdOn":"November 20, 2020","topics":[{"id":"09c582e0-1ea7-5fe8-891e-e22a2297f238","title":"Smart Home","slug":"smart-home"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3d9793e-e832-5dd1-b2e7-3931b34d42eb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
