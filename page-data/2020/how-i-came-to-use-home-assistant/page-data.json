Not by strongest language.</p>\n<p><strong>OpenHAB</strong><br>\nA serious contender however it didn't do it for me in the way of management,\nthe graphics are good however the support for MQTT or likewise platforms cut short when I was researching this platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Domoticz</strong><br>\nThis system did work in every way I liked, however it was way to heavy for my system, however the support for an mqtt platform was a little low.</p>\n<p><strong>Home Assistant</strong><br>\nThis is the system of my choice for now. It is written in Python just like Domoticz but has a way more extendable feel. Plus there is a huge community and support for all the things I need (mqtt among others).</p>\n<p>So after using Home Assistant for almost a year I am still feeling it and will continue to use it for the forseeable future.</p>"}},"createdOn":"December 15, 2020","topics":[{"id":"09c582e0-1ea7-5fe8-891e-e22a2297f238","title":"Smart Home","slug":"smart-home"},{"id":"7ac707f2-ec70-599b-9136-a942e8094fa7","title":"Docker","slug":"docker"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"d48e41c3-74ae-59f4-a2e3-16d477c5e29f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
