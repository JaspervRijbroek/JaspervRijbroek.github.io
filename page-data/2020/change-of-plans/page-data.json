And after a disassembly I found out that it doesn't have an antenna, which\nwas the initial issue.</p>\n<p>However, there is a small thing to keep in mind, that is that the lights of the Ikea do require\na constant supply of 230V(olts) which might be a little strange when changing a light bulb,\nbut then again how much does that happen a year. In my 7 years in this house I had to change a\nlight bulb twice.</p>\n<p>At the end of this month my new smart switch will be delivered, and I will go to Ikea to retrieve\na couple of Tradfi light bulbs, and then I will try to set it up again, but this time\na little more aesthetically pleasing for my wife.</p>\n<p>When this is done I will post some more pictures with the first test scenarios and how\nthe wife responds to them.</p>"}},"createdOn":"June 01, 2020","topics":[{"id":"09c582e0-1ea7-5fe8-891e-e22a2297f238","title":"Smart Home","slug":"smart-home"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"3a83fa05-7c2b-5772-9267-7260cc39245d"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3079026735","3443059693","3615297349"]}
