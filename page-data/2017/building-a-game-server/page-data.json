However the context is completely different than Raddish and thus also the way of thinking.</p>\n<p>For the following time I will be building a lot of things for this server, and making it into something nice.</p>\n<p>If you like to follow my progress <a href=\"https://github.com/JaspervRijbroek/aurora\">see here</a>. However there might be a chance in the future\nthat this repo is being given a private tag, because another server which I know of get a cease and desist and a DCMA.</p>\n<p>We will see what the future holds.</p>","fields":{"date":"January 24, 2017","path":"/2017/building-a-game-server"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building a game server","description":"A new challenge"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
