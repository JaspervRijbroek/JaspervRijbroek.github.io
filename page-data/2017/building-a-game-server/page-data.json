However the context is completely different than Raddish and thus also the way of thinking.</p>\n<p>For the following time I will be building a lot of things for this server, and making it into something nice.</p>\n<p>If you like to follow my progress <a href=\"https://github.com/JaspervRijbroek/aurora\">see here</a>. However there might be a chance in the future\nthat this repo is being given a private tag, because another server which I know of get a cease and desist and a DCMA.</p>\n<p>We will see what the future holds.</p>","fields":{"date":"January 24, 2017","path":"/2017/building-a-game-server"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building a game server","description":"A new challenge","topics":["gaming","server"]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"nodes":[{"id":"f6fc15d2-f73e-5b69-93cb-498378955efb","fields":{"date":"October 15, 2019","path":"/2019/docker-all-the-things"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker all the things"}},{"id":"691e2c69-65da-5752-8262-ac598ac19ebe","fields":{"date":"April 04, 2019","path":"/2019/my-new-server"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My new server"}},{"id":"29d9c18b-9340-59bf-92ea-5244d662e2ea","fields":{"date":"June 07, 2016","path":"/2016/a-new-way-of-gaming"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A new way of gaming"}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"6d6f0dcb-ff11-5265-8592-405832b7fe0f","topics":["gaming","server"]}}}
