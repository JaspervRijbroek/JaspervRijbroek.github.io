However the context is completely different than Raddish and thus also the way of thinking.</p>\n<p>For the following time I will be building a lot of things for this server, and making it into something nice.</p>\n<p>If you like to follow my progress <a href=\"https://github.com/JaspervRijbroek/aurora\">see here</a>. However there might be a chance in the future\nthat this repo is being given a private tag, because another server which I know of get a cease and desist and a DCMA.</p>\n<p>We will see what the future holds.</p>"}},"createdOn":"January 24, 2017","topics":[{"id":"bdb5516c-e431-5788-975d-858691c1c155","title":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"},{"id":"a9563439-cc17-55dd-9999-b37c3983943d","title":"Server","slug":"server"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"57d68216-1c13-5828-9dc0-8cee869d153c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3079026735","3443059693","3615297349"]}
