As I don't want any spies or other wise entries into my home, unless I say so! (yes, I am a control freak)</p>\n<p>There where the following protocols to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WiFi</li>\n<li>Z-Wave</li>\n<li>Zigbee</li>\n<li>RF (Radio Frequency)</li>\n<li>Proprietary</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proprietary</strong><br>\nThis was off the bat a no go, as there was no control over on what happens and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>WiFi</strong><br>\nMy main concern here was security and privacy, as the device has a connection to the WiFi it could do all kinds of nasty things like send out usage, or make it a little more interesting, execute code on my network received from external source, so a no go.</p>\n<p><strong>RF (Radio Frequency)</strong><br>\nThe issue I had with this protocol is that there is no communication between the devices, it is just one way, so when turning on or off a device the controller sends out 3 messages, hoping that one will be received, apart from the range issue. A pro, devices have no internet access, but can be succeptable to hackers as you only need to transmit an RF signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Z-Wage</strong><br>\nThis is a neck on neck race with Zigbee, the main weakness in my account is that it can controll up to 232 devices, which in the beginning seems like a huge number, but it will keep growing pretty quickly when you get hooked. Security wise it is great as the devices themselves have no internet access.</p>\n<p><strong>Zigbee</strong><br>\nFor me in my context this is the winner as it supports networks with a lot of devices going into the 1000s, is secure in home using zigbee2mqtt, is cheap using xiaomi/ IKEA components. And as another secure part it has no internet access of its own.</p>\n<p>So that is the short of it, I will keep my devices on zigbee using zigbee2mqtt.</p>\n<p>See you later!</p>"}}}},{"node":{"id":"57d2f291-54a4-5dbc-8ecd-f16adae2aa1e","title":"Review of the new stack","slug":"review-of-the-new-stack","teaser":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A nice new balance of management and presentation.</p>"}},"fields":{"path":"/2020/review-of-the-new-stack"},"body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After a couple of days using contentful as CMS, I am very pleased in using this system, the way of writing content in a separate management system that is purely focussed on just that, content.</p>\n<p>Also using it in Gatsby which I now have come to love as well, using node on the generation side, and using React on the frontend is also very nice.\nThis even after knowing that my first project with React was a disaster, I have now came to appreciate it for now.</p>\n<p>Hopefully soon I will start working on the dark mode of this website so it will become readable at night without blinding you ;)</p>"}}}},{"node":{"id":"f0545bb0-eb59-5eee-b012-70e8fb0a2f28","title":"Another automated room","slug":"another-automated-room","teaser":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This one has been on my mind for a long time.</p>"}},"fields":{"path":"/2020/another-automated-room"},"body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Its time for another automated room thanks to IKEA Tradfri. this time its the livingroom lights.</h2>\n<p>I have had this idea for a long time laying around already and today I got the green-light from my wife :D</p>\n<p>When we where at IKEA I bought myself a few tradfri lights, after that I have installed them directly when I got the time and setup the automations.
