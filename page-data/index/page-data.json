(yes, I am a control freak)</p>\n<p>There where the following protocols to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WiFi</li>\n<li>Z-Wave</li>\n<li>Zigbee</li>\n<li>RF (Radio Frequency)</li>\n<li>Proprietary</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Proprietary</strong><br>\nThis was off the bat a no go, as there was no control over on what happens and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>WiFi</strong><br>\nMy main concern here was security and privacy, as the device has a connection to the WiFi it could do all kinds of nasty things like send out usage, or make it a little more interesting, execute code on my network received from external source, so a no go.</p>\n<p><strong>RF (Radio Frequency)</strong><br>\nThe issue I had with this protocol is that there is no communication between the devices, it is just one way, so when turning on or off a device the controller sends out 3 messages, hoping that one will be received, apart from the range issue. A pro, devices have no internet access, but can be succeptable to hackers as you only need to transmit an RF signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Z-Wage</strong><br>\nThis is a neck on neck race with Zigbee, the main weakness in my account is that it can controll up to 232 devices, which in the beginning seems like a huge number, but it will keep growing pretty quickly when you get hooked. Security wise it is great as the devices themselves have no internet access.</p>\n<p><strong>Zigbee</strong><br>\nFor me in my context this is the winner as it supports networks with a lot of devices going into the 1000s, is secure in home using zigbee2mqtt, is cheap using xiaomi/ IKEA components. And as another secure part it has no internet access of its own.</p>\n<p>So that is the short of it, I will keep my devices on zigbee using zigbee2mqtt.</p>\n<p>See you later!</p>"}}}},{"node":{"id":"57d2f291-54a4-5dbc-8ecd-f16adae2aa1e","title":"Review of the new stack","slug":"review-of-the-new-stack","createdOn":"November 16, 2020","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/2b9ee/2160x450.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/c8a1d/2160x450.jpg 20w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/0cce2/2160x450.jpg 40w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/2b9ee/2160x450.jpg 80w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/76539/2160x450.jpg 120w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/e5d64/2160x450.jpg 160w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/dbe5e/2160x450.jpg 2160w","srcWebp":"/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/abac3/2160x450.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/c05ea/2160x450.webp 20w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/0aa94/2160x450.webp 40w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/abac3/2160x450.webp 80w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/f0218/2160x450.webp 120w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/4013d/2160x450.webp 160w,\n/static/1587534ed9ea49bf12c1dc8875bcb3df/ffeae/2160x450.webp 2160w","sizes":"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px"}}},"teaser":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A nice new balance of management and presentation.</p>"}},"fields":{"path":"/2020/review-of-the-new-stack"},"body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After a couple of days using contentful as CMS, I am very pleased in using this system, the way of writing content in a separate management system that is purely focussed on just that, content.</p>\n<p>Also using it in Gatsby which I now have come to love as well, using node on the generation side, and using React on the frontend is also very nice.\nThis even after knowing that my first project with React was a disaster, I have now came to appreciate it for now.</p>\n<p>Hopefully soon I will start working on the dark mode of this website so it will become readable at night without blinding you ;)</p>"}}}},{"node":{"id":"f0545bb0-eb59-5eee-b012-70e8fb0a2f28","title":"Another automated room","slug":"another-automated-room","createdOn":"November 08, 2020","image":null,"teaser":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This one has been on my mind for a long time.</p>"}},"fields":{"path":"/2020/another-automated-room"},"body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Its time for another automated room thanks to IKEA Tradfri. this time its the livingroom lights.</h2>\n<p>I have had this idea for a long time laying around already and today I got the green-light from my wife :D</p>\n<p>When we where at IKEA I bought myself a few tradfri lights, after that I have installed them directly when I got the time and setup the automations.

shock and cultural experience,\nwe found a cultural and culinary experience, but in my experience the cultural was better.</p>\n<p>Both my wife and I didn't really get a culture shock as we prepared quite a lot for this vacation,\nbut still an impressive country, however the vacation didn't had a flying start when we landed.</p>\n<p>After we landed we quickly found ourselves into an even more bureaucratic situation then The Netherlands,\neverything was to be documented, also the customs office was even more crowded than on Bali (I thought this to be impossible), but very thorough and every document was inspected to every detail.</p>\n<p>After that passed we quickly found our suitcases and had to fill in even more documentation,\nthen off to the hotel, Hotel Lumiere Kasai at Kasai metro station, took us an hour by bus.</p>\n<p>After settling in and sleeping on night and the day after we were fresh to go out, after a stop at the 7-11,\nWe went to Tokyo center, Sensō-Ji, Akihabara and imperial palace.</p>\n<p>The most impressive place was Akiba (short for akihabara) the anime, maid cafes and a lot of electric stuff,\neverything you might have ever needed, hence the name electric town, been here in total of 5 times in 2 weeks (oops).</p>\n<p>However Shibuya crossing was a little disappointing as we thought it to be way bigger, (thanks to Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift) well drifting was a thing there in Tokyo, seen a little to much quickly followed by police (lol).</p>\n<p>But after two weeks of staying with these friendly people and doing a lot of things, we will come back again but then on the other end of Japan, next time will be Osaka, the more traditional end of Japan.</p>"}}}},{"node":{"id":"e868d126-17f1-5adb-99a4-a765f6c7382e","title":"Another year of
