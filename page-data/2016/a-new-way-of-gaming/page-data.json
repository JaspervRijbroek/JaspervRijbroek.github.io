And soon, when I have a NVidia GPU, I can game on the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>This is done through the NVidia GameStream protocol which is compatible for the RasPI and other devices.</p>\n<p>So no more big chunky case in the way, but only a tiny RasPI. However there is also a downfall!\nThis isn't something heavy gamers should be looking at for the graphics are compressed to save the network load.\nSo if you are a casual gamer then this might be a solution ;).</p>","fields":{"date":"June 07, 2016","path":"/2016/a-new-way-of-gaming"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A new way of gaming","description":"Something different about gaming"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
