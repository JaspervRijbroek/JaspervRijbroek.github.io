And soon, when I have a NVidia GPU, I can game on the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>This is done through the NVidia GameStream protocol which is compatible for the RasPI and other devices.</p>\n<p>So no more big chunky case in the way, but only a tiny RasPI. However there is also a downfall!\nThis isn't something heavy gamers should be looking at for the graphics are compressed to save the network load.\nSo if you are a casual gamer then this might be a solution ;).</p>"}},"image":null,"createdOn":"June 07, 2016","topics":[{"id":"436f2f3b-31d9-5fc7-b104-8bdcca0d4acc","title":"Cloud","slug":"cloud"},{"id":"bdb5516c-e431-5788-975d-858691c1c155","title":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"}]},"allContentfulPost":{"nodes":[{"id":"4fb20f1f-f65f-59be-854b-1320c25973cd","title":"Upgade","createdOn":"February 15, 2021","body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It seems like almost a decade ago that I have bought my last system, ow wait, it has been a decade ago...</p>\n<p>Yes now I still can I wanted to buy a new system, as I am almost sure that the upcoming 6 years this will not be possible anymore.</p>\n<p>So first an introduction of the old system.</p>\n<p><a\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n          href=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/kpop3c9xmw9n/1v4wF1o9O5FxOa654rCnNY/0efafee99017dcb968cef00ea30f0c3f/WhatsApp_Image_2021-02-15_at_7.38.33_AM.jpeg\"\n          style=\"display: block\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener\"\n        >\n          <span\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n        style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n      >\n        <span\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n          style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAlgCWAAD/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wAARCAA1ACgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABQAEBgMB/8QALxAAAgEDAwIDBgcBAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQREiExBRNBYXEiQlGBkbEGMkNScsHR8P/EABcBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgP/xAAcEQEBAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhAjESEzL/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AOMt3lViyhiPStXekmuYi4IQEE54FJdQslhsI0kdkDSM5ZfIAUX2rEDBmcn+Jq8Jyde4gK57oHyrJJfwgERyjV4bGipobIrpiZ9Z4JG1fekCOG8L3K+wo4Iz8xUYPJK1njhEYYMVHJC81U7aQ2vUrIPHAvtDBwoyD/29VX60eQ/rTiSGFG0hTFk4G4J4rnrYMk6dxPHfUKd620qXJjKEQ6AFOOdhv9aHlTUyjJwPeHgaXLtpPlsv7YSntxKoJRSAMAFgN/tRG6khtnGx8c01OkxMbFSrKux/dkHcVmv7Zpp5XhXIbDE/AkcUqUJfhu4ZVltzKyPqLFgmsfCqsPSLsWPUYJCNSfqDGdjzmqtOPSLNuh6/GXRFHuxE7+tEx2h0yIU0nP5ydsEZ/v7V0N9bvNIZMoqdvTvnOfSshtrNUKy36oWOWCuMfQ0WbEuh72ukx9woFbgjfI/zzrxuibGOWEJoZxjTkZG/NNJd9KhRI3nadUXSBp88/AVmlvOkSSGQ2skrls5dsD71Nm1QJ0y9WAyC4Mmh88EH12NVMjq1vGwa26XbIR4suqqgbD36MFZu4x9d6zRglcljVVSptCKMDbmvVAM8eVVVIPTjb51VVUB//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n        >\n          <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"My old PC\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/kpop3c9xmw9n/1v4wF1o9O5FxOa654rCnNY/0efafee99017dcb968cef00ea30f0c3f/WhatsApp_Image_2021-02-15_at_7.38.33_AM.jpeg\"\n        srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/kpop3c9xmw9n/1v4wF1o9O5FxOa654rCnNY/0efafee99017dcb968cef00ea30f0c3f/WhatsApp_Image_2021-02-15_at_7.38.33_AM.jpeg?w=300 300w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/kpop3c9xmw9n/1v4wF1o9O5FxOa654rCnNY/0efafee99017dcb968cef00ea30f0c3f/WhatsApp_Image_2021-02-15_at_7.38.33_AM.jpeg?w=600 600w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/kpop3c9xmw9n/1v4wF1o9O5FxOa654rCnNY/0efafee99017dcb968cef00ea30f0c3f/WhatsApp_Image_2021-02-15_at_7.38.33_AM.jpeg?w=1200 1200w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n        </span>\n      </span>\n        </a></p>\n<p>What you see here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AMD Phenom II 955BE</li>\n<li>2x Geil 4GB dragon memory</li>\n<li>Asrock Extreme3 780 Motherboard</li>\n<li>Be!
