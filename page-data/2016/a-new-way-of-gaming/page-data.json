And soon, when I have a NVidia GPU, I can game on the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>This is done through the NVidia GameStream protocol which is compatible for the RasPI and other devices.</p>\n<p>So no more big chunky case in the way, but only a tiny RasPI. However there is also a downfall!\nThis isn't something heavy gamers should be looking at for the graphics are compressed to save the network load.\nSo if you are a casual gamer then this might be a solution ;).</p>"}},"createdOn":"June 07, 2016","topics":[{"id":"436f2f3b-31d9-5fc7-b104-8bdcca0d4acc","title":"Cloud","slug":"cloud"},{"id":"bdb5516c-e431-5788-975d-858691c1c155","title":"Gaming","slug":"gaming"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"388eb9fd-a75d-56b0-8c78-ffd1228f5542"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1919614393","3443059693","3615297349"]}
