## Aurora Private Server
This is one of my longest and biggest passions I have had the pleasure of working on.  
The project is a complete private server build in JavaScript for a game.

This project includes the complete game server (will still take 99+ years to be completed),  
a websystem and a launcher for the gamers.

This is an electron desktop app build for AdeptGamer,  
it will allow the users to install games without any hassle.

The complete interface was written in React.
