So this website theme is serving me for quite some years already and I feel very satisfied with it still,
however Jekyll has done its best to keep up with my demands, but it can no longer do it.

So I have moved to [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
but based on nodejs and react.

This will add a lot more functionality to the website like fluid images, more control and a lot more cool stuff.

Also a search bar has been added to make searching this website a little more easy, this incorporating [Algolia](https://algolia.com)
for speedy search results. 

The only thing I will still be adding is pagination to the homepage, this will follow in the upcoming days/ weeks.
