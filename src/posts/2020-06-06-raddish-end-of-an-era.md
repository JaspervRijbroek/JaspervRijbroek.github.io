Raddish a pride and joy for quite some years, now I have to let it go.  
What started out as a framework to support multiple databases and relations between these have served its purpose.

Raddish was the first framework to support multiple databases which began with MySQL and MongoDB in the first days,  
after being exposed on InfoQ other frameworks followed the trend very shortly.

However after no development has been done for 3 years it is time to let it go, as of today the repo has been archived and the package
on NPM will be deprecated. Next week it will be completely removed.

The site will remain operational until the DNS lease is done, after that the site will be terminated as well, this will make room
for future projects which I can dedicate more time and attention to.
