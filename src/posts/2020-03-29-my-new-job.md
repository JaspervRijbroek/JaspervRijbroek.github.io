description: Keeping things up to date

So it has been a while since I let something be heard of me, yes I am still alive.
Looking at the current circumstances I hope that it keeps that way with the corona virus...

## New employer
For the last couple of months I work at a new employer [Sition](https://sition.nl) with a lot of fun and a whole lot more colleagues.
Having exciting and broad spanning clients and missions.

Most fun challenge is that we are now introducing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for local development.

## A start with home automation
In the upcoming months I will be starting with home automation based on [ZigBee](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
I will be posting my findings here on this site.

## A new website
Might be that you haven't noticed this but the website has been changed, not too much though.
The main feature is that I have now moved to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) at the core.

A lot more features will be added such as search and tags/ topics.

## Aurora
Lets not forget my brain child here, not that much has been going on with Aurora as I am now more involved with AdeptGamer or atleast
I try to be, working on the new backend.

More updates are coming in this year as I will be having quite a lot more free time (hopefully) than the last years.

So see you soon!!
