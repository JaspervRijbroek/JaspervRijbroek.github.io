This is an old recipe from my dad, now in digital format.

## What do we need
I will make a list of the ingredients you need per portion.

- 120grams chicken fillet
- 90grams unprepared rice
- 1 paprika (yellow/ red)
- Kerrie spices
- 1 onion
- 1 clove of garlic
- half a table spoon of Maizena
- olive oil
- 0.2 liter of Chicken stock
- Cream (optional)
- *Chili powder (only for the brave)*

## How to prepare
First cook the rice, as this will take some time we can prepare the kerrie in the mean time.

Cut the onions, garlic and paprika, after this put them on a low fire with the lid on and let them simmer.
Dont forget to stir sometimes so they don't burn.

In the meantime cut the chicken in your preferred way and add them after the onions and paprika have shrunk..

Keep the lid on until the chicken is done, while stirring some times.

Now add the maizena and stir it through the kerrie, after this add the kerrie spices to your own taste,
then slowly add the chicken stock while stirring.
Only add some cream if you want it more creamy. 

Now take the rice add the kerrie and enjoy.
