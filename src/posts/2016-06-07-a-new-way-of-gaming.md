Gaming, something most of us do at some point ofcourse everyone on his or her own way.  
That also goes for mine, currently I am gaming on a MacBook pro and an ancient old laptop and the game is The Witcher 3.

Yes it is possible as it seems, and soon to be possible on my Raspberry Pi B (first batch).

So how did I do this?  
Some time ago I found a post about [gaming in the cloud](http://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html).
But at the current time the prices for these EC2 instances became to high and I didn't actually give it a real go,
however inspired I tried Steam In-Home streaming which gave a solution. And soon, when I have a NVidia GPU, I can game on the Raspberry Pi.

This is done through the NVidia GameStream protocol which is compatible for the RasPI and other devices.
 
So no more big chunky case in the way, but only a tiny RasPI. However there is also a downfall!
This isn't something heavy gamers should be looking at for the graphics are compressed to save the network load.
So if you are a casual gamer then this might be a solution ;).
