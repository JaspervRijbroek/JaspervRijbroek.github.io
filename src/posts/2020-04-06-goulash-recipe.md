This is an old recipe from my dad, now in digital format.

## What do we need
I will make a list of the ingredients you need per portion.

- 120grams chicken fillet
- 90grams unprepared rice
- 1 paprika (yellow/ red)
- Silvo goulash spice mix
- 3 onions
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1 teaspoon of paprika powder
- olive oil
- Peas

## How to prepare
First cook the rice, as this will take some time we can prepare the goulash in the mean time.

Cut the onions, garlic and paprika, after this put them on a low fire with the lid on and let them simmer.
Dont forget to stir sometimes so they don't burn.

In the meantime cut the chicken in your preferred way and add them after the onions and paprika have shrunk, now is also the time to add the paprika powder.

Keep the lid on until the chicken is done, while stirring some times.

Now we can add the spices, make sure there is enough fluid in the pan, either from the simmering of added water,
now add te goulash spice mix to your flavor, you can't go wrong here as long as you keep tasting.

Now we can add the peas and stir them into the goulash.

Now take the rice add the goulash and enjoy.
