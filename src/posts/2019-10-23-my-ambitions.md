title: My ambitions
description: What do I want from my future?
---

Some time ago someone asked what are my ambitions and what do I want to learn for myself.

Since this time I am more and more confronted with myself asking the same thing, what is it that I want to achieve and what I want to learn or like to do the most.

Honestly, these are some heavy questions.

My ambition is a Lead Developer, don't mind if it is in PHP or NodeJS or perhaps another language.
_Another one of my ambitions is to become a good father in about a year or two ;)_

But what I would want to learn, this is an even tougher nut to crack, I have been thinking about this for a couple of days nowâ€¦

The answer that I have come up with aren't things I would like to learn, but more things I would like to do and fiddle with.

One of the major things is testing and testing frameworks as I have done way too little with them,
another one is who, where and when to throw and catch error/ exceptions.

But further, I have complete love of the language(s) as a whole and don't love or hate a specific things.
