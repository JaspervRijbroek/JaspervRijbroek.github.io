title: Server update
description: Massive storage upgrade
topics: ['server']

Since as long as I have a server it has always have been running a single harddisk,
now also since I have my latest server I am very worried about my data security.

So as the newest addition to this server is a RAID card I have added 3 more disks totalling at 4 with
a total storage of 9TB.

The RAID has been setup with RAID-5, which basically means that the data is written on 3 disks,
and on the last disk a parity file is created, which in case of a crashed/ broken disk the original file
can be regenerated using this parity file.

As a nice part of an enterprise RAID controller is the added hardware check if the harddisks are healthy,
so now I also have the guarantee that the drives (and data) will be in tip top shape for the coming years.

Now to find a way to sync files from IOS and Android to an SMB share,
will also write an update on this later.
