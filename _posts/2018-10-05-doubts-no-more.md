description: The end of the doubts
---

Since the last blog post I wrote and now things have become very busy at work, almost to a point that I think I am breaking under the preassure....

Anyhow this also made me realize, that in my career I never actually had any preasure for things to be done at a certain time and had to make a lot of overtime.

This also made me realize that if this was my own personal company it would have been to much of everything.

So I have no decided that my own company will have to wait till... well I don't know maybe never.

Also with the expectation of a small wonder, things require a little more solidity instead of adventure, so in the long run it might indeed be the better idea as well.
