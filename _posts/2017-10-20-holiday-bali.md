description: My own wedding ceremony
---

It is time agaim for a holiday to Bali however this time with an active vulcano and a lot of plans.

Yes it is known for some time now that the vulcano of Bali is spewing smoke.
We have seen this first hand in the airplane yesterday (different flight route it seemed) and to be honest it didn't look that impressive
, Beleive me if i say the news maked it much more worse.

Also they say in the news there are a lot of earthquakes however I haven't felt a single till now.

In a few days we will travel north with a distance of about 60 KM of mount Agung for the wedding ceremony wich will last for 3 days.
I don't know what is going to happen but it will prove to be much fun and a whole new experience.

I will keep you posted :)
