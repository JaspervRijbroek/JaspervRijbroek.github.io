title: Building a game server
description: A new challenge
---

Its been some time since I let something of me being heard.  
This is mainly because I spend my time programming for Raddish and Aurora.

Raddish is a long standing project of a few years already in which I am trying to create
a beautiful, fast and intuitive framework within node.js.

However since a few weeks before the start of 2017 I started a second project.
This time a private server of the game Mabinogi.

This is a huge challenge however the personal reward is huge at the same time and just like Raddish
it is a completely new system. However the context is completely different than Raddish and thus also the way of thinking.

For the following time I will be building a lot of things for this server, and making it into something nice.

If you like to follow my progress [see here](https://github.com/JaspervRijbroek/aurora). However there might be a chance in the future
that this repo is being given a private tag, because another server which I know of get a cease and desist and a DCMA.

We will see what the future holds.
