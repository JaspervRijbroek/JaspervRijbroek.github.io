description: A company that stops
---

For the most of you reading this post it might be a small shock, but don't be alarmed.
I also own a company with the same name which is going to stop this February.

After running this company for too long without real results, and ofcourse moving to my new job.
I have decided that I will give up on this company so I can focus on personal projects and my job at [Teemr](http://teemr.works)

This being said, is still have some side projects which need to be finished, this will be done in the next week so I can
go back to works with an empty mind, which should be very refreshing.
